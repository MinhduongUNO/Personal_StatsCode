The research question is whether GMAT score from 2012 to 2016 differs from state to state among the chosen four in the Midwest: Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and South Dakota.

The null hypothesis is that: u1 = u2 = u2 = u4
The alternative hypothesis is that there is at least one state who has the mean GMAT score significantly different from the other three

Because the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. Now we look at if age, state and the interaction of the two independent variables affect GMAT score
